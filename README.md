# Bitly Converter Automation

## Automates tiresome process of converting 100s and 1000s of campaign URL
A Desktop application that automates URL shortening process using Bitly APIs. This application runs the API in a loop per line items in an Excel and paste the shortened URL back. This application also creates PNG of QR code of the shortened URL and pastes in a folder; on configuration it will have the QR code image in byte format in the excel adjacent to the shortened URLs. 

This was built to automate shortening of ~20K URLs regularly. This saves ~4 minutes per URL and is absolutely free.

**C#, ASP.Net, Desktop Application**
## Vision

The vision is to automate mundane and tedious tasks to save time and money both. And obviously to do it the smart way.
